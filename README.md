Vanadium parallelizes entity, block-entity, scheduled and chunk ticking, natural spawning,
and entity tracking. A shared worker pool runs work in separate parts of the world concurrently:
regions adapt to where the work is, nearby work never overlaps, and each stage completes before the next.
It also optimizes chunk lookups, nearby-player indexing and packet preparation.

### Performance

  <img src="docs/assets/performance-light.svg" alt="Historical Minecraft 26.2 results: 7.6 TPS with parallel ticking off and 81.3 TPS on at 32 workers. A separate worker sweep peaks at 76.3 TPS at 36 workers, falling to 68.5 at 48.">

### Getting started

Use **Minecraft 26.3**, **Fabric Loader 0.20.1+** and **Java 25+**. Build with `./gradlew build`
([setup](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md)), then place the release jar from `build/libs/` in `mods/` alongside:

- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) and [Fabric Language Kotlin](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-language-kotlin)
- [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) and [C2ME](https://modrinth.com/mod/c2me-fabric)

**C2ME is required:** it handles parallel generation/loading while Vanadium handles ticking.
**Lithium and VMP are incompatible.** Test your world and modpack before deployment.

Configure `config/vanadium.toml`; use `/vanadium reload` to apply changes and
`/vanadium status` to inspect them. Worker-count changes require a restart.
